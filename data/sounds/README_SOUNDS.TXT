About The Sound Files Used In This Game
---------------------------------------

Some of the sound files used in this game were made exclusively by myself (Sam
Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I place under the Gnu GPL as dictated by the
COPYING file in the root directory of this archive. Those files are:

excuseme.wav
bite.wav
run.wav
splat.wav

The following files are taken from tuxmath and where made by Bill Kendrick
<bill@newbreedsoftware.com> - the files are also place under the GPL:

game.mod
game2.mod
game3.mod
laser.wav
pause.wav	
tock.wav
explosion.wav  	
alarm.wav
buzz.wav
lose.wav
pop.wav
shieldsdown.wav

Sam got the following two files from a CD with copyright-free stuff ("they were
sounds you could legally use to sample, remix, use elsewhere, without having to
get permission or any acknowledgement back to the author"):

win.wav 	 	
winfinal.wav

Emmett Plant (emmett@sonivius.com) is the author of tuxi.ogg and released it in the public domain.

This game is under the Gnu GPL (again, see COPYING) and is open-source. While
this does not preclude it from being included in a commercial packade (such as a
Linux distro) this software is required to be freely distributable. 

If you have any further questions (or you feel a sound file used in this
open-source game has a copyright conflicting enough to not be included
with a Gnu GPL software title) please contact me at hart@geekcomix.com

Thx.

ADDENDUM - the previously present files with license problems (kmus1-4.wav, click.wav) have all been removed
and replaced with 100% free and redistributable alternatives.  I believe the sound files in Tux Typing are
now fully compliant with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

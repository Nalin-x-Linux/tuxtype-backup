About The Images Used In This Game
----------------------------------

The majority of the graphics used in this title were made
exclusively by myself (Sam Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I
place under the Gnu GPL (as dictated by the COPYING file in the
root directory of this archive). These images were created
either natively in the GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/) or were hand
drawn, scanned, and manipulated via the GIMP.

Tux was originally drawn by Larry Ewing <ltlewing@isc.tamu.edu>. 
Certain images used in this game were modified from his original 
Tux images found at http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/

The remainder of the images are featured images from Wikimedia Commons. 

I'm pretty sure that covers everything that may potentially
cause problems... but just in case I left something out, I can
assure you that any image used in this game was freely
distributable to the best of my knowledge.

Thx.

(PS: As a reward for those of you that read these readme files,
you may notice a file called "hidden.gif" in this directory. The
image is royalty free from same places as *cas*.gif files above
are. But what's significant about it is that it's a special hidden
background level. Simply use "tuxtype --hidden" to use it as the
default background for level 4 on each difficulty level! Enjoy! ;)

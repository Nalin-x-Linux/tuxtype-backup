Windows Crossbuild by:
	David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com>

Newer mingw-cross-env crossbuild (still under construction) made possible thanks to extensive help from ming-cross-env maintainer, Volker Grabsch.

To install the binary package for Tux Typing for Windows:

1. Run the nsis installer file (e.g. tuxtype-1.8.1-win32-installer.exe)
2. Click to review the terms of the GPL.
(Note - you actually have the legal right to install and run the program
irrespective of what you think of the GPL, but the NSIS installer
program needs a click to proceed with installation.  The GPL covers
copying, not use.  You no more need a license to simply *use* software
than you need a license to read a book or newspaper!).
3. Click OK to install in default path (C:\Program Files\TuxType) or
select alternate location (perhaps if you are logged in as a user
without privileges to write to C:\Program Files).
4. The installer will create menu entries and a desktop icon for Tux
Typing if permissions allow.
